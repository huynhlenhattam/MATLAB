# Vibration Measurement using Oscilloscope and MATLAB
An oscilloscope is used to measure the analog waveform from the radar sensor and send the digital data to MATLAB. File read_waveform_from_oscilloscope.m stores the data into 2 arrays: X (time) and Y (amplitude). fft_radar_waveform.m analyzes the signal using FFT. preprocess.m is a filter function.
