# Vibration Measurement using HB100 radar sensor and MATLAB
An oscilloscope is used to measure the analog waveform from the HB100 radar sensor and send the digital data to MATLAB. File read_waveform_from_oscilloscope.m stores the data into 2 arrays: X (time) and Y (amplitude). fft_radar_waveform.m analyzes the signal using FFT. preprocess.m is a filter function which is generated from the Signal Processing Toolbox in MATLAB.
